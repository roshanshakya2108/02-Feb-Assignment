    "## Answer 1: \n",
    "**Flask Framework:**\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is minimalistic and has a small footprint, making it fast and easy to understand.\n",
    "Flexibility: Due to its simplicity, developers have more control and flexibility over their application design and architecture.\n",
    "Extensibility: It allows developers to add any extensions they need for additional functionalities.\n",
    "Easy to Learn: Flask has a simple and readable codebase, which makes it easy for beginners to pick up.\n",
    "Modular: Flask allows for modular programming, meaning you can split your app into multiple smaller modules.\n",
    "Integrated Unit Testing: Flask supports unit testing, which helps ensure the reliability and quality of the application.\n",
    "Good Documentation: Flask comes with comprehensive and well-structured documentation."
