    "An API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a messenger between different software applications. It defines a set of rules and specifications that allow apps to talk to each other and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life Example: Imagine you're using a weather app. The app itself doesn't store weather data. Instead, it uses an API to communicate with a weather service's database and retrieve the latest temperature, forecast, etc. This API acts as the middleman, fetching the data you see on the weather app"
