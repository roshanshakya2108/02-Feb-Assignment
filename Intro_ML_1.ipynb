    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "AI in healthcare can be seen in diagnostic systems like IBM Watson Health, which analyzes medical records to provide treatment recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A spam email filter is a machine learning system that learns to identify and classify emails as spam or non-spam based on patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets.\n",
