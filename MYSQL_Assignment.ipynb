    "A database is a structured collection of data that is electronically stored and organized in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation.  Think of it as a giant filing cabinet for information, but instead of folders and papers, you have tables, rows, and columns to organize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are like well-organized filing cabinets with predefined structures for data. They use a special language (SQL) to access information. NoSQL databases are more flexible, like filing boxes where you can store different kinds of data and adjust the organization as needed. They use different query methods depending on the data format.  Choose SQL for structured data and complex queries, NoSQL for big or unstructured data that needs to scale.\n"

    "DROP: This removes unwanted database objects entirely. Be careful, as dropped data is permanently gone! Think of throwing away old folders and their contents.\n",
    "ALTER: This modifies the structure of existing tables. You can add new columns, change data types, or remove columns you don't need anymore. This is like adding new compartments to existing folders or changing the labels.\n",
    "TRUNCATE: This removes all the data from a table, but keeps the table structure itself. Imagine emptying all the files out of a folder but keeping the folder itself for future use.\n",
