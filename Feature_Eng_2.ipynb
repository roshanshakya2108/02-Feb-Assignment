    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method in feature selection evaluates the relevance of features by their intrinsic properties, independent of any machine learning algorithm. It ranks features based on statistical tests or measures such as correlation, mutual information, or statistical significance. Features that score above a certain threshold are selected for the model."

    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets based on their performance with a specific machine learning algorithm. It uses a search strategy to find the best subset of features by training and evaluating the model iteratively, often using techniques like cross-validation. The Wrapper method tends to provide better results as it considers feature interactions but is computationally expensive compared to the Filter method."
